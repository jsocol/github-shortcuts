# Github Shortcuts

Use your keyboard to navigate around Github. Adds a few global navigation
shortcuts, like gh to go to your dashboard, or gn to go to navigation. All
shortcuts start with g:

* gh - Go do your dashboard.

* gn - Go to your notifications.

* gi - Go to your inbox.

* gy - Go to your recent actions.

* gp - Go to your pull requests.

* gr - Go to one of your repositories.


## To use the `gr` shortcut:

`gr` opens and focuses a text field. Type the name of a repository and hit
`<Enter>` to navigate to that repository. You can also hit `<Escape>` to close
the text field.
